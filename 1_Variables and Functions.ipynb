Functions also break up our code into smaller, more manageable pieces.  This is important for debugging and testing.  Functions also enable us to create libraries of code that can be used in other programs.  This is important for sharing code and collaborating with others.\n",

We then *call* the `print` function thus executing some predefined code.  Notice that the `print` function has brackets/parenthesis `()` after it.  This part of the syntax of calling a function.  The brackets are used to pass in any information that the function needs to do its job.  For example, the `print` function needs to know what to print.  We can pass this information in as follows:"
